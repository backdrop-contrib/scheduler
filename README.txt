This module adds scheduled publish/unpublish capability to Drupal.
Specifically, two dropdowns are added to node forms for automatically
publishing or unpublishing a node at some future date. The actual
publish/unpublish operation is handled by Drupal's cron hook.

An admin page (admin/node/scheduler) is added under the 'content'
tree. This page informs admins on all schedules.
