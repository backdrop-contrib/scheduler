# Scheduler

**STATUS: Port in progress**

This module allows content to be published and unpublished on specified dates.

Dates can be entered either as plain text or with the core Date Popup widget.

## Installation

 - Install this module and its dependencies using the official 
  [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules)

## Configuration and Usage

 - Grant users the permission "Schedule content publication" to allow them to
   set when the content they create is to be (un)published.
 - Checkboxes are provided when configuring content types, allowing you to
 enable scheduled publishing and/or unpublishing for that content type:
